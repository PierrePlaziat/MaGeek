# MaGeek

.Net Magic The Gathering Library Manager and deck builder

## Description

Serveur and desktop application:
You can run the server on local or on docker.
  
Powered by MtgJson and Scryfall, Thanks to them all mtg data is available!
  
## Stack

- Wpf / community toolkit mvvm / AvalonDock
- Identity Framework / Entity Framework / sqlite
- GRpc / Docker
  
I heavily take advantage of .net
trying to be the most seemless possible
reducing at maximum friction beetween technologies.
I try to reach the most elegant architecture i can come with
making it evolve as i gain knowledge
and eventually make a template out of it.
