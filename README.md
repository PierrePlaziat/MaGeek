WPF MTG Library Manager 

## Description

I needed a tool to manage my MTG card collection on local drive, that reflect my needs, which can eventually evolve.

## Functionalities

-	Advanced Search
-	Collection gestion
-	Proxy printing
-	Price estimations
-	Nice UI

## TODO

-	Proxy : 
	-	prevent null deck
	-	last card wont appear
	-	link checkboxes
- 	Error hash access
-	finish collection estimation

### Maybe later

-	Recent cards/searches 
-	Auto deck / Deck helper
-	Better preco importer (waiting for mtgsqlive to furnish data)
