.Net Magic The Gathering Library Manager and deck builder

## Description

Serveur and desktop application:

I heavily take advantage of .net
trying to be the most seemless possible
reducing at maximum friction beetween technologies.
I try to reach the most elegant architecture i can come with
making it evolve as i gain knowledge
and eventually make a template out of it.

-	Exaustive MTG informations
-	Collection gestion
-	Deck building
-	Printing
