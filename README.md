WPF MTG Library Manager 

## Description

I needed a tool to manage my MTG card collection on local drive, that reflect my needs, which can eventually evolve.

## Functionalities

-	All paper cards support including fun
-	Decks/sets/lists gestion
-	Proxy print
-	Foreign language suport
-	Auto update card data
-	IDE style movable panels
-	Stats and tags

## TODO

### Planned

-	debug collection estimation
-	support $ currency (currently all â‚¬)
- 	Menu Language and currency show currently selected
-	rework list importer
-	Show set completness
-	double clic instead of simple click on set card

### Then

-	Retest and polish set explorer, deck stats and deck table
-	Better proxy ux

### Maybe later

-	Auto deck / Deck helper
-	Recent cards/searches
-	Better preco importer (waiting for mtgsqlive to furnish data)
