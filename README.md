WPF MTG Library Manager 

## Description

I needed a tool to manage my MTG card collection on local drive, that reflect my needs, which can eventually evolve.

## Functionalities

-	Advanced Search
-	Collection gestion
-	Proxy printing
-	Price estimations
-	Nice UI

## TODO

-	finish collection estimation
-	got cards from variant wont work well if !onlythisvariant
- 	

### Maybe later

-	Recent cards/searches 
-	Auto deck / Deck helper
-	Better preco importer (waiting for mtgsqlive to furnish data)
